
Java 17:
=================
Java 17 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, bringing major enhancements, performance improvements, and API changes.


Language Features
----------------------


1. Sealed Classes (Finalized) — Restrict class inheritance

2. Pattern Matching for switch (Preview) – Cleaner and more expressive switch

3. Records (Finalized from Java 16) – Concise data classes

4. Instanceof Pattern Matching (Finalized from Java 16) – Cleaner type checks.

5. Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators -  provides new interfaces and implementations for Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG).

public IntStream getPseudoInts(String algorithm, int streamSize) {
    // returns an IntStream with size @streamSize of random numbers generated using the @algorithm
    // where the lower bound is 0 and the upper is 100 (exclusive)
    return RandomGeneratorFactory.of(algorithm)
            .create()
            .ints(streamSize, 0,100);
}


6.  Text Blocks – Multi-line string literals (""")

Performance & Memory Improvements
----------------------------------------

1. ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) Enhancements : Lower latency, better scalability.
Lower latency:
Java 17 reduces GC pause times, ensuring that GC does not exceed 1 millisecond(earlier 2–10ms), even with larger heaps (up to 16TB compare to 4TB and more efficient for large-scale applications).This is ideal for low-latency applications like trading systems, real-time analytics, and cloud-based services.

Better scalability:
Thread Stack Processing fully concurrent(Earlier it was partial).


When to Use ZGC?

-Low-latency applications (Trading, Gaming, AI, Real-time Analytics)
-Microservices running in cloud environments
-Large-memory applications (Big Data, Machine Learning)

2. Always-Strict Floating Point Semantics — Ensures predictable floating-point operations   
Before Java 17, floating-point calculations in Java were sometimes affected by platform-specific optimizations, leading to: Inconsistent results across different JVM implementations.

Java 17 enforces strict floating-point semantics globally, The strictfp keyword is no longer needed because all floating-point calculations now follow strict IEEE 754 rules.
